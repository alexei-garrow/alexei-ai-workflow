# Task Execution

This document is for breaking down and executing individual tasks. For each task, we will define the task, its acceptance criteria, and the test cases that will be used to verify it.

---

## Task: [Task Title]

**Ticket:** (Link to the corresponding ticket in `TICKETS.md`)

**Description:** (A clear and concise description of the task.)

### Acceptance Criteria

(A list of criteria that must be met for the task to be considered complete.)

*   

### Test Cases

(A list of test cases that will be used to verify the functionality. This should include both positive and negative test cases.)

*   **Test Case 1:** (Description of the test case)
    *   **Given:** (The initial state)
    *   **When:** (The action that is taken)
    *   **Then:** (The expected outcome)

### Potential Risks & Edge Cases

(What could go wrong? What are the unhappy paths we need to consider?)

*   

### Security Considerations

(What are the security implications of this task? Refer to `protocols/SECURITY.md`.)

*   

### AI's Proposed Plan

(The AI will propose a plan to implement the task. We can choose one of two approaches depending on the nature of the task.)

**Approach:** (Detailed Plan | Iterative Development)

---

**Option 1: Detailed Plan**

*(Best for well-defined tasks where the requirements are clear.)*

**Goal:** (The goal of this plan)

**Steps:**
1.  (Step 1)
2.  (Step 2)
...

**Verification:** (How the AI will verify that the task is complete)

---

**Option 2: Iterative Development**

*(Best for exploratory work, UI/UX tasks, or when requirements are uncertain.)*

**Goal:** (The high-level goal of this task)

**Iteration 1:**
*   **Goal:** (e.g., Build a minimal UI mockup)
*   **Steps:** ...
*   **Outcome:** (e.g., A visual mockup for user review)

**User Feedback & Next Iteration Plan:**

(After each iteration, the user will provide feedback, and we will define the goal for the next iteration.)

---

### QA

(Before approving the plan, refer to the `QA.md` protocol and ask the relevant questions.)

### User Approval

(The user must approve this plan before the AI can start working on the task.)

**Approved by:** (user's name)
**Date:** (date)
