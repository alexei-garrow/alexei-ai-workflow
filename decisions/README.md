# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the project. An ADR is a short document that captures a single, significant architectural decision, along with its context and consequences.

## Why ADRs?

*   **Clarity:** They provide a clear, historical record of *why* certain technical decisions were made.
*   **Onboarding:** They help new team members understand the technical evolution of the project.
*   **Consistency:** They prevent us from re-litigating the same decisions in the future.

## Process

1.  When a significant architectural decision needs to be made, copy the `ADR-TEMPLATE.md` to a new file named `[YYYYMMDD]-short-description.md`.
2.  Fill out the template with the context, decision, and consequences.
3.  We will discuss the proposed ADR. Once accepted, the status will be updated.
4.  A summary of the decision can be logged in `notes/NOTES.md` with a link to the full ADR file.
