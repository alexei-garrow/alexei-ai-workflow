# Alexei's Ai workflow

A first draft for AI workflows.

The main idea / concept being guardrails of sorts. I want to minimise problems early on by giving a clear outline with guidelines.

The idea is that this repo will be cloned into other repo's and used as the 'Ai workflow'. 

Ideally this not only prevents oversights, but also cuts down on some of the repititive prompts.



As the technology evolves, this could be a very good way to go moving forward!
