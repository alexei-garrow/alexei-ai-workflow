# Core Principles

This document outlines the core principles that guide our collaboration. These principles are designed to ensure that we work together effectively, safely, and with a shared understanding of our goals.

## 1. Consult Before Acting

**The AI must not take any action without consulting the user and getting their approval.**

This is the most important principle. It prevents the AI from making mistakes due to a lack of context. For every task, the AI must propose a plan and get the user's approval before executing it.

## 2. Provide Full Context

The user will make an effort to provide as much context as possible for each task. The AI will ask clarifying questions if the context is not sufficient. This helps to avoid misunderstandings and ensures that the AI has all the information it needs to complete the task correctly.

## 3. Iterate and Improve

We will work in an iterative manner, breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. We will use the `RETROSPECTIVES.md` file to regularly review our workflow and identify areas for improvement.

## 4. Automate Everything (That Can Be Automated)

We will strive to automate as much of our workflow as possible, using the `CI-CD.md` file to plan our automation strategy. This includes automated testing, building, and deployment.

## 5. Quality First

We will prioritize the quality of our work, using the `QA.md` protocol to ensure that every task and every release meets our quality standards. We will never sacrifice quality for speed. For example, we will never disable a failing test to make the build pass.
