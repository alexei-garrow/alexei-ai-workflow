# Gemini Ai Workflow Tickets

This document outlines the workflow for our project. It's designed to ensure that we (the user and the AI) are always on the same page and that the AI never takes actions without explicit approval.

## The Core Principle: Consult Before Acting

**The AI must not take any action without consulting the user and getting their approval.**

This means that for any task, the AI must:

1.  **Understand the task:** The AI must first understand the task at hand. This may involve asking clarifying questions.
2.  **Propose a plan:** The AI must then propose a plan of action. This plan should be detailed enough for the user to understand what the AI is going to do.
3.  **Get approval:** The AI must then get the user's approval for the proposed plan.

Only after the user has approved the plan can the AI take action.

## The Workflow

The workflow is as follows:

1.  **The user creates a ticket:** The user will create a ticket in this document for each task that needs to be done.
2.  **The AI analyzes the ticket:** The AI will analyze the ticket and propose a plan of action.
3.  **The user approves the plan:** The user will review the plan and approve it.
4.  **The AI executes the plan:** The AI will execute the plan.
5.  **The user reviews the work:** The user will review the work and provide feedback.

## Ticket Template

> **Note:** For each new ticket, create a new `TASK-EXECUTION.md` file in the `workflows` directory. You can use the `workflows/TASK-EXECUTION-TEMPLATE.md` as a starting point. The new file can be named `workflows/TASK-[Ticket-Number].md`.

### Ticket #[Ticket Number]: [Ticket Title]

*   **Status:** (Backlog | To Do | In Progress | Done)
*   **Description:** (A brief description of the task)
*   **Link to `TASK-EXECUTION.md`:** (Link to the corresponding task execution file)

## Tickets

*   **Ticket #1:** Create the initial project structure and workflow files.
