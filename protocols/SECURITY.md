# Security Protocol

This document outlines the security principles and practices to be followed in this project. Our goal is to build a secure and trustworthy application.

## Core Principles

*   **Security by Design:** Security is not an afterthought. It is a primary consideration at every stage of the development lifecycle.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Components and users should only have the minimum level of access required to perform their functions.
*   **Defense in Depth:** We will use multiple layers of security controls to protect our application.
*   **Stay Informed:** We will make an effort to stay informed about the latest security threats and vulnerabilities.

## Security Checklist

This checklist should be reviewed for every task to ensure we are adhering to our security principles.

*   **Input Validation:** Are all inputs from users and external systems validated?
*   **Output Encoding:** Is all output properly encoded to prevent XSS attacks?
*   **Authentication:** Is the identity of the user or service verified?
*   **Authorization:** Does the user or service have the necessary permissions for the requested action?
*   **Secure Data Handling:** Is sensitive data handled securely (e.g., encrypted at rest and in transit)?
*   **Error Handling:** Are error messages generic and do not expose sensitive information?
*   **Dependency Management:** Are all dependencies up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities?

## Authentication

*   **Strategy:** (To be decided. e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0, session-based)
*   **Password Policy:** If we manage passwords, we will enforce a strong password policy.
*   **Secure Storage:** Passwords and other credentials must be securely stored (e.g., using bcrypt).

## Authorization

*   **Strategy:** (To be decided. e.g., Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC))
*   **Implementation:** Authorization logic must be enforced on the server-side for every request that requires it.
*   **Edge Cases to Consider:**
    *   What happens when a user tries to access a resource they don't own?
    *   What happens when a user with a lower privilege level tries to perform an admin-level action?
    *   How are permissions handled for deactivated or deleted users?

## Security in the Workflow

*   **`TASK-EXECUTION.md`:** The "Security Considerations" section of this document must be filled out for every task.
*   **Code Reviews:** All code changes should be reviewed for potential security issues.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** The CI/CD pipeline should include automated security scanning tools (SAST and DAST) if possible.
