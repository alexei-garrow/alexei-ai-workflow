# Observability Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for observing the application's behavior and performance. Observability helps us understand what's happening inside the system from the outside.

---

### Core Principle

We should be able to understand the internal state of our application from the outside, allowing us to debug issues and monitor performance effectively.

### For a Small Project / Prototype

For a small project that is not in production, a complex observability setup is overkill. The focus should be on simple, effective debugging.

*   **Logging:**
    *   **What:** Print informative log messages to the console (`stdout`/`stderr`).
    *   **How:** Use a standard logging library for the language/framework. Log key events, errors, and important data points.
    *   **Goal:** To have enough information to understand the flow of execution and debug issues when running the application locally.

### For a Production Application

For a production application, a more robust strategy is needed to ensure reliability and performance. This typically involves the "three pillars of observability."

*   **1. Logging:**
    *   **What:** Centralized, structured logging.
    *   **How:**
        *   Logs should be written in a structured format (e.g., JSON).
        *   Logs from all parts of the system should be collected into a central logging service (e.g., Datadog, Splunk, ELK Stack).
    *   **Goal:** To be able to search, filter, and analyze logs from across the entire application in one place.

*   **2. Metrics:**
    *   **What:** Time-series data that represents the health and performance of the system.
    *   **How:**
        *   Instrument the code to collect key metrics (e.g., request rates, error rates, response times, CPU/memory usage).
        *   Use a monitoring service (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog) to store and visualize these metrics.
        *   Set up alerts to be notified when key metrics cross critical thresholds.
    *   **Goal:** To get a high-level overview of the system's health and be alerted to potential problems proactively.

*   **3. Tracing:**
    *   **What:** A way to track a single request as it travels through all the different services and components of the application.
    *   **How:**
        *   Use a distributed tracing library (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Jaeger) to instrument the code.
        *   Each request is given a unique trace ID, which is passed along its entire journey.
    *   **Goal:** To be able to visualize the entire lifecycle of a request, identify bottlenecks, and understand the dependencies between services.
