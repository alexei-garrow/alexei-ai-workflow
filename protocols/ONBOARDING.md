# Onboarding Guide

This document provides instructions for setting up the project for the first time. A smooth onboarding process helps new contributors (human or AI) get up to speed quickly.

---

### Core Principle

A new contributor should be able to get the project running on their local machine with a minimal number of steps.

---

### For a Small Project / Prototype

For a small project, the onboarding process should be as simple as possible.

*   **Prerequisites:**
    *   List the essential tools that need to be installed (e.g., Node.js version, Python version).
*   **Installation:**
    *   Provide the exact command to install the project's dependencies (e.g., `npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
*   **Running the Application:**
    *   Provide the exact command to start the application locally (e.g., `npm run dev`, `python app.py`).

---

### For a Production Application

For a larger, more complex application, the onboarding process needs to be more detailed.

*   **Prerequisites:**
    *   A comprehensive list of all required tools and their specific versions.
    *   Links to installation guides for each tool.

*   **Installation:**
    *   The command to install dependencies.
    *   Instructions for any additional setup steps (e.g., setting up a local database, running database migrations).

*   **Configuration:**
    *   A clear explanation of the environment variables used in the project.
    *   Instructions on how to create a local environment file (e.g., copying `.env.example` to `.env.local`) and what values to put in it.

*   **Running the Application:**
    *   The command to start the application.
    *   Information about any other services that need to be running (e.g., a local database, a mock server).

*   **Running Tests:**
    *   The command to run the entire test suite.
    *   Instructions on how to run a single test file or a subset of tests.

*   **Project Overview:**
    *   A brief description of the project's architecture and folder structure.
    *   Links to other key documents in this workflow repository (`PLANNING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, etc.).
