# Quality Assurance Protocol

This document outlines the two-stage Quality Assurance (QA) process we will follow for this project.

## Stage 1: Task-Level QA

This stage occurs after the AI has proposed a plan for a specific task in `TASK-EXECUTION.md`. Before approving the plan, the user should ask the following questions:

*   Is the plan clear and easy to understand?
*   Does the plan fully address all the requirements of the task?
*   Are there any potential risks or edge cases that the plan doesn't account for?
*   Is there anything missing from the plan?

## Stage 2: Project-Level QA

This stage occurs after a significant milestone, such as an MVP or a final release. It's a chance to look back at the work that was done and assess its quality.

The process is as follows:

1.  **Review the original plan:** Re-read the relevant `PLANNING.md` and `TASK-EXECUTION.md` files.
2.  **Review the work done:** Examine the code, documentation, and any other artifacts that were produced.
3.  **Answer the following questions:**
    *   Does the final product meet the goals and requirements outlined in the plan?
    *   Is the code well-written, easy to understand, and maintainable?
    *   Are there any bugs or errors?
    *   Are there any parts of the code that could be refactored for better performance, clarity, or efficiency?
    *   Is the overall quality of the work up to an acceptable standard?

This process can be documented in the `RETROSPECTIVES.md` file.
