# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for this project. Our goal is to ensure the delivery of a high-quality, reliable, and maintainable product.

## Guiding Principles

*   **Test for Confidence:** We write tests to be confident in our code and to enable fearless refactoring.
*   **Pyramid of Tests:** We will strive for a balanced portfolio of tests, with a wide base of unit tests, a smaller number of integration tests, and a few end-to-end tests.
*   **Automate First:** All tests should be automated and runnable with a single command.
*   **Clarity is Key:** Tests should be clear, concise, and easy to understand. A good test serves as documentation for the code it covers.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Tests

*   **Goal:** To verify that individual components (e.g., functions, classes) work correctly in isolation.
*   **Scope:** The smallest testable part of an application.
*   **When:** These should be written for all new code.
*   **Tools:** (To be decided based on the technology stack)

### 2. Integration Tests

*   **Goal:** To verify that different components of the application work together as expected.
*   **Scope:** This is where we will focus on testing API endpoints. We will test the interaction between our API and the database, external services, and other parts of our system.
*   **API Endpoint Testing Best Practices:**
    *   Test for successful responses (2xx status codes) with valid inputs.
    *   Test for error responses (4xx and 5xx status codes) with invalid inputs (e.g., bad data, missing parameters).
    *   Test authentication and authorization for each endpoint.
    *   Test for correct data creation, retrieval, updates, and deletion (CRUD).
    *   Test response payloads to ensure they match the defined contract.
*   **Tools:** (To be decided based on the technology stack, e.g., Postman, Supertest, Pytest)

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests

*   **Goal:** To verify that the entire application works as expected from the user's perspective.
*   **Scope:** Simulates a real user journey through the application.
*   **When:** These will be created for critical user flows.
*   **Tools:** (To be decided based on the technology stack, e.g., Cypress, Selenium, Playwright)

## Test Execution

*   **Local:** Developers should run tests locally before pushing code.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** All tests will be run automatically in the CI/CD pipeline on every push and pull request, as defined in `CI-CD.md`. A build will fail if any test fails.
