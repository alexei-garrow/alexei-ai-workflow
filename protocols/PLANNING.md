# Project Planning

This document is for the project planning phase. Here, we will define the project's goals, scope, and technology stack.

## 1. Project Goals

(To be filled in by the user. What are the high-level objectives of this project? What problem are we trying to solve?)

---

## 2. Scope

### In Scope

(To be filled in by the user. What are the features and functionalities that are definitely part of this project?)

*   

### Out of Scope

(To be filled in by the user. What are the features and functionalities that are explicitly not part of this project? This helps to manage expectations.)

*   

---

## 3. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

(To be filled in by the user. What is the absolute minimum set of features required for the first release of this product?)

*

## 4. Technology Stack

(To be filled in by the AI, with user approval. The AI will propose a technology stack based on the project goals and scope.)

| Category      | Technology | Reason |
| :------------ | :--------- | :----- |
| Frontend      |            |        |
| Backend       |            |        |
| Database      |            |        |
| Deployment    |            |        |
| Testing       |            |        |

## 5. User Approval

(The user must approve this plan before we proceed to the next phase.)

**Approved by:** (user's name)
**Date:** (date)

## Adapting for Existing Projects

If you are using this workflow for a project that is already in progress, you can "reverse-engineer" this planning document by following these steps:

1.  **Analyze the existing codebase:** Read through the code to understand its purpose, features, and architecture.
2.  **Document the project goals:** Based on your analysis, fill out the "Project Goals" section.
3.  **Define the scope:** Document the existing features in the "In Scope" section. You can also identify features that you plan to add in the future.
4.  **Identify the MVP:** If the project is already an MVP, document its features. If not, define what would constitute an MVP.
5.  **Document the technology stack:** Fill out the "Technology Stack" table with the technologies that are currently being used in the project.
